# Ideas for project extensions

Purpose: dump for future dev ideas for platform (not for writing)

- Include the css and index files in the working folder so can preview there?
- Sync the YAML front matter with the H1 heading so they are always consistent

## Claude ideas

- Interactive menu system with options to:
  - Selectively publish individual files (choose which staged files to publish)
  - Publish only without rebuilding entire site
  - Rebuild site without publishing
  - Start server without publishing/rebuilding
  - Separate commands via command-line flags (--serve, --convert-all, etc.)
