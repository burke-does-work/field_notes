    <p><strong>Tinkering</strong>: hands-on experimentation toward a loose goal. Tinkering enables satisfaction-generating activities without needing to be directly satisfying itself. In my world, there are two types: outdoorsing and denning.</p>
    <p><strong>Outdoorsing:</strong> tinkering that enables outdoor activities. Think: building out a camper truck so I can go camping.</p>
    <p><strong>Denning:</strong> tinkering that enables comfortable reclining activities. Think: building a home server so I can watch Parks and Rec.</p>
    <p><strong>Work:</strong> doing stuff to get paid. Outdoorsing and denning aren’t work because they aren’t done for payment.</p>
    <p><strong>Hobbies:</strong> activities that are ends in themselves - a person does them for their own sake. Outdoorsing and denning aren’t hobbies because they’re means to an end, not ends in themselves.</p>
