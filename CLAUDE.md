# Doc for Claude directions

## Context

Read the entire project at the start of a session.

## Commits

Draft the conventional commits after each iteration. I will copy the text and do the commit myself.

## Self-citing

Do not cite yourself any where. This is my work, not yours. For example, in a commit, do not include garbage like this:

>ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
