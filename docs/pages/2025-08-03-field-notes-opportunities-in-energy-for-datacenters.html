    <p>Purpose: talking points on challenges and opportunities in energy for data centers. You already know the background - use these bullets to talk to the issues at a high level.</p>
    <h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
    <p>The challenges for data center power procurement are no different from many other industrial facilities. Except: time to power has become the biggest consideration in data center location selection.</p>
    <p>Planning issues:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Reliability</li>
    <li>Environmental impact</li>
    <li>Cost</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Construction issues:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Infrastructure for power access</li>
    <li>Power equipment supply chain times</li>
    <li>Skilled workers (especially electrical trade workers)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These issues are made more acute by:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Need for fast build time</li>
    <li>Scale</li>
    <li>Self-imposed renewable goals</li>
    <li>Gold-plated reliability</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="business-opportunities">Business opportunities</h2>
    <p>In a bull market, opportunities exist across the value chain.</p>
    <h3 id="siting-and-connection">Siting and connection</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Energy supply in tier 2 locations where time to power is lower</li>
    <li>Merchant transmission when regulated T&amp;D is too slow</li>
    <li>Behind the meter solutions</li>
    <li>Co-location with other industry</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="generation-and-supply-chain">Generation and supply chain</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Onshoring and friendshoring of the renewable supply chain (can cater to data center needs)</li>
    <li>Smaller companies or unique business models equipment supply chains</li>
    <li>Modularization and pre-fab</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="teasers-for-discussion">Teasers for discussion</h2>
    <p>Talking points are a high-level outline to be both basic and comprehensive. Some unorganized, unrefined ideas:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Independent data centers offering full renewable power supply.</li>
    <li>Solutions to speed up the interconnection queue.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="throw-away-thought-recession-proofing">Throw-away thought: Recession proofing</h3>
    <p>Recession proofing for periods of overcapacity. Flexibility to scale down energy costs or target different data center use cases (i.e.Â not just tuned for model training)</p>
