# Markdown Style Guide

## Headings

### Capitalization

#### H1 (Title Case)

Capitalize each word, except for articles, conjunctions, or prepositions, unless they start the heading or are after a dash or semicolon.

Examples:

- Field Notes - Technical Architecture
- The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over the Lazy Dog
- Publishing Workflow: A Guide for Writers

#### H2-H5 (Sentence Case)

Only capitalize the first word of the heading or any word after a dash or a semicolon.

Examples:

- Publishing workflow
- Core technologies
- Publishing workflow: A guide for writers
- Image handling and path management

### Spacing and format

Use only the heading tags for headings. Do not use other formatting (such as bold) for a heading.

Where I don't want a formatted heading, use plan text with a colon.

## Lists

Single space between the list block and the text above and below.

### Unordered lists
