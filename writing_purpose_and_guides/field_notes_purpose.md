# Field notes - Context

## The setup

I write "field notes" to my future self. These fields notes are often distributed to others, but they receive the field notes as if they are on "cc".

I use the term field notes because the topic is things I'm actively working through but there isn't a final conclusion at the time of distribution. The allusion to anthropology is not accidental.

I aim for the notes to be interesting to read in 6-months time but I'd like them to also be interesting out 2+ years.

I do insights, not briefings.

## The intelligent layperson

When I write, I assume the future self meets the "intelligent layperson" standard, but they do not recall the knowledge or thought process related to the specific topic of the note.

Outside of background, summaries, etc., I provide brief context when needed, and then I add additional text or resources in a footnote if I think it adds value over the internet. I assume the intelligent layperson has access to the internet and is sufficiently adept at using Google or an LLM for more information.

## The "you" allergy

I don't like being told what to do, and I don't like expressions like "you should". Unsolicited advice is rarely welcome.

 Even if "you" refers to my future self, I want to make sure there's no confusion if the note is shared.

I use a combination of first-person ("I") and the imperative. I don't use second-person("you") and prefer "a person" when talking generally.
