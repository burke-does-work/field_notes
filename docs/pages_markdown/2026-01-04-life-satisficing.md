# What Is Life Satisficing?

## Life satisficing

Life satisficing is a mashup of "life satisfaction" and "satisficing".

It's the process of seeking to meet or surpass a minimum level of contentedness or satisfaction.

### Life satisfaction

Life satisfaction is the subjective dimension of well-being and used as an indicator of health. It's a level of subjective well-being or contentedness.

For the happiness index type things, life satisfaction is often measured on the Cantril Scale, talked about [here](https://news.gallup.com/poll/122453/understanding-gallup-uses-cantril-scale.aspx#:~:text=The%20Cantril%20Self%2DAnchoring%20Scale,%2C%20&%20Arora%2C%202009.)

The Cantril Scale goes:

> Please imagine a ladder with steps numbered from zero at the bottom to 10 at the top.
> The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you.
> On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time? (ladder-present)
> On which step do you think you will stand about five years from now? (ladder-future)

Who in their right mind answers a 10? And it seems bananas to have an index where the top number isn't achievable. But maybe this is all just me.

### Satisficing

The economist Herbert Simon came up with the term satisficing. For my loose definition: satisficing is an approach to decision making where a person looks through options until a threshold is met. This is opposed to a running an optimization to meet an objective function in their head.

It's tied to the concept of bounded rationality. Herbert Simon is one of my favs.

You can read the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing) to get the real explanation of it.

### Life satisficing

Bringing the themes together:

Life satisficing sets a threshold - "this is good enough" - and the optimization stops once it is hit.

### Digressions

**Verbs vs. nouns**: I like using the verbs instead of the nouns, because they are process-oriented, which is another way to say the hackneyed expression "it's better to travel well than to arrive". Even though in my opinion, as long as the travel isn't really shitty, I'd much rather arrive.

**Perfectionism & optimization**: Herbert Simon is one of the earliest to kick-off behavioral economics so there's lots that comes after, and I won't pretend to be educated on it. But there's an interesting loop between satisficing and optimization as it relates back to well-being. If a perfectionist is an optimizer, and perfectionism leads to lower subjective well-being, then is the optimized outcome, in fact, to be a satisficer? F' me.
