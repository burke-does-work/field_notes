# Field Notes: Talking Points and Teasers on Energy for Data Centers

Purpose: talking points on challenges and opportunities in energy for data centers. You already know the background - use these bullets to talk to the issues at a high level.

## Challenges

The challenges for data center power procurement are no different from many other industrial facilities. Except: time to power has become the biggest consideration in data center location selection.

Planning issues:

- Reliability
- Environmental impact
- Cost

Construction issues:

- Infrastructure for power access
- Power equipment supply chain times
- Skilled workers (especially electrical trade workers)

These issues are made more acute by:

- Need for fast build time
- Scale
- Self-imposed renewable goals
- Gold-plated reliability

## Business opportunities

In a bull market, opportunities exist across the value chain.

### Siting and connection

- Energy supply in tier 2 locations where time to power is lower
- Merchant transmission when regulated T&D is too slow
- Behind the meter solutions
- Co-location with other industry

### Generation and supply chain

- Onshoring and friendshoring of the renewable supply chain (can cater to data center needs)
- Smaller companies or unique business models equipment supply chains
- Modularization and pre-fab

## Teasers for discussion

Talking points are a high-level outline to be both basic and comprehensive. Some unorganized, unrefined ideas:

Independent data centers offering full renewable power supply.

Solutions to speed up the interconnection queue.

### Throw-away thought: Recession proofing

Recession proofing for periods of overcapacity. Flexibility to scale down energy costs or target different data center use cases (i.e. not just tuned for model training)
